# CS330-Final
Comp Graphics and visual design



        When I started working on this assignment, I had no idea what I was doing with OpenGL. I 
    started off trying to get my first thing to render as a cylinder which took a lot of effort.
    After I got that to work properly, I started continuously build on that concept until the camera,
    texture, and lighting were completed. From there I added the rest of objects in the scene. I 
    believe this would be called CD/CI. At the begining of each week I would set out a plan on reading
    the assignments, and planning what needs to be implemented into the project, what needed to be done
    first, what I did know, and what I didnt know. From there, I performed the reading and tutorials 
    and searched online to fill the gaps in knowledge that I know I would need for the assignment. 
    For instance understanding the logic of a cylinder. Or rendering multiple objects. I feel like this
    class did give me a lot of confidence in learning and researching things that I do not know 
    without copy-pasting code that is not mine. On a professional level, I have knowledge in something
    different that opens doors to other opportunities to grow.
