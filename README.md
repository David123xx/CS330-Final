# CS330-Final
Comp Graphics and visual design

When I started working on this assignment, I had no idea what I was doing with OpenGL. I started off trying to get my first thing to render as a cylinder which took a lot of effort. After I got that to work properly, I started continuously build on that concept until the camera,texture, and lighting were completed. From there I added the rest of objects in the scene. I believe this would be called CD/CI. At the begining of each week I would set out a plan on reading the assignments, and planning what needs to be implemented into the project, what needed to be done first, what I did know, and what I didnt know. From there, I performed the reading and tutorials and searched online to fill the gaps in knowledge that I know I would need for the assignment. For instance understanding the logic of a cylinder. Or rendering multiple objects.I
